# Installation:
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*


# Project Motivation:

In this project, I was interestested in using Seattle Airbnb Dataset from Kaggle to better understand:

1- What is the Seattle neighbourhood that has houses with higher prices?

2- What is the Seattle neighbourhood that has houses with the cheapest prices?

3- Which type of properties is the most expensive in Seattle?


# File Descriptions:

This file contains a notebook in which the entire analysis process is shown. There is also a listings.csv that contains the data used to answer the above questions.
